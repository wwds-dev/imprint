"""The interface an agent panel needs from the application.

This is the seam the panel split rests on. Panels talk to the host through this
protocol rather than reaching into `GodAI`, which is what lets a panel move to
its own module (phase 4) without carrying the whole window with it.

Runtime-checkable so a test can assert a stand-in satisfies it; `GodAI` conforms
structurally and does not inherit from it.
