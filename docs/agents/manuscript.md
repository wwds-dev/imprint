# PUBLISHER — Publishing metrics, marketing content, and launch tracking

`key: manuscript` · class: `agents/manuscript_agent.py → ManuscriptAgent` · panel: `build_manuscript_panel()` · handlers: `manuscript_refresh()`, `manuscript_ingest_kdp()`, `manuscript_ask()`, `quote_finder_suggest()`, `manuscript_generate_quote_graphic()`, `manuscript_generate_short()`, `manuscript_generate_calendar()`, `manuscript_add_todo()`

> Not to be confused with the **Manuscript** left-panel button (`key: author`, see [author.md](author.md)) — that's the writing studio. This agent, labelled **Publisher** in the UI, picks up once a draft exists: sales data, launch content, and the publishing checklist.

## What it does
Five tabs covering the post-draft, pre/post-launch side of publishing a book:

1. **Overview** — PublishDrive sales/royalty summary, a question box grounded in that data, and the publishing todo checklist.
2. **Quote Finder** — load the manuscript (`.txt`/`.pdf`/`.epub`/`.mobi`) or paste an excerpt; the agent extracts a batch of verbatim, screenshot-worthy lines. Each candidate has inline buttons to turn it directly into a graphic or a narrated short.
3. **Quote Graphics** — turn one quote into a styled PNG (3 themes, square or vertical) for Instagram/Pinterest/TikTok — pure Pillow, no API cost.
4. **Shorts** — narrate a quote (free on-device TTS by default, ElevenLabs optional) and combine it with a quote graphic into a vertical MP4 via ffmpeg.
5. **Calendar** — turn the Quote Finder candidates into a dated posting schedule across TikTok/Instagram/Pinterest, with a platform-native caption per post and a one-click Graphic / Short button per row, then export the whole plan as a CSV punch list for manual posting.

## Inputs (panel controls)
| Control | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Period selector / Refresh Data | Pull PublishDrive sales for the selected window. |
| Ingest KDP CSV | Parse new files dropped in `data/kdp_reports/`, dedup by filename. |
| Ask box + Provider/Model | Chat Q&A grounded in the last-fetched sales JSON. |
| Publishing Todos list + Add/Done | Lightweight checklist, seeded with a standard launch checklist on first use. |
| Quote Finder: text box / Load File / quote count / theme / voice / attribution | Source text and generation settings for batch quote extraction. |
| Quote Graphics: quote / attribution / theme / size | Single-graphic generation settings. |
| Shorts: quote / attribution / theme / voice source / voice | Single-short generation settings. |
| Calendar: weeks / start date / platform checkboxes / theme / voice / attribution | Scheduling + asset-generation settings for the whole batch. |

## Outputs
Sales JSON and chat responses in the Overview text browser. PNGs in `data/quote_graphics/`. MP4s in `data/shorts/`. Todos persisted in the `manuscript_todos` DB table. Calendar exports a CSV wherever you choose to save it.

## How it works
`ManuscriptAgent.build_messages()` injects the last-fetched sales JSON as system-prompt context so Q&A stays grounded. `build_quote_suggestions_messages()` uses a dedicated prompt that requires quotes to be exact substrings of the source (verified in testing — the model does not paraphrase). `services/quote_graphics.py` renders a vertical gradient + wrapped serif text with Pillow — no external API. `services/shorts_generator.py` narrates via `providers/voice/` (mock/system `say` by default, ElevenLabs optional) then combines the narration with the quote-graphic PNG via a single `ffmpeg -loop 1 -i image -i audio` call — the exact pattern used by `services/course/video_assembler.py`.

**Calendar** splits scheduling from writing deliberately: `services/content_calendar.py: build_calendar()` is pure Python (no LLM) that assigns quotes to day/platform/format slots by a fixed weekly cadence per platform (TikTok 4/wk short, Instagram 3/wk alternating graphic/short, Pinterest 7/wk graphic), cycling quotes if there are more slots than quotes — deterministic and free. Captions are the one LLM step: all slots go out in a *single* batched call (`build_calendar_caption_messages()`), not one call per post, and come back as a JSON array parsed by the same `_parse_quote_list()` helper Quote Finder uses. Each row's Graphic / Short button reuses the exact same generation path as Quote Finder and Shorts — `render_quote_graphic()` / `ShortsWorker` — so there's one asset pipeline, not three.

## Under the hood — files & functions
| Location | Role |
|---|---|
| `agents/manuscript_agent.py` | `ManuscriptAgent` — sales-summary, PublishDrive/KDP parsing, quote-suggestion, and calendar-caption prompts. |
| `services/publishdrive_client.py` | PublishDrive REST wrapper (`PUBLISHDRIVE_API_KEY`). |
| `services/kdp_csv_parser.py` | KDP CSV ingestion + dedup; `manuscript_seed_todos()` seeds the checklist. |
| `services/quote_graphics.py` | `render_quote_graphic()` — Pillow gradient + text render, 3 themes, 2 sizes. |
| `services/shorts_generator.py` | `render_short()` — TTS + ffmpeg image/audio combine. |
| `services/content_calendar.py` | `build_calendar()` — pure scheduling, no LLM, no deps. |
| `providers/voice/mock.py` / `elevenlabs.py` | TTS backends (free macOS `say`, or ElevenLabs). |
| `services/narrator/converter.py: load_text()` | Reused for Quote Finder's file loader (pdf/epub/mobi/txt extraction). |
| `main.py: build_manuscript_panel()` + tab builders | 5-tab UI. |
| `main.py: quote_finder_*`, `manuscript_generate_*`, `_quote_finder_*` | Handlers + the `ShortsWorker` background thread. |
| `main.py: manuscript_generate_calendar()`, `calendar_generate_asset()`, `manuscript_export_calendar_csv()` | Calendar handlers. |
| `services/database.py` | `manuscript_metrics`, `manuscript_kdp_ingested`, `manuscript_todos` tables. |

## Extend it
- **Distribution integration**: a Buffer/Metricool API push from the exported calendar CSV — the natural next step once you're generating more content than you want to upload by hand.
- **Ad-campaign briefs**: KDP/Amazon Ads keyword lists and Meta boost structuring — Market mode covers organic copy, not paid.
- **Review-outreach tracking**: extend `manuscript_todos` into a light contact tracker (who got an ARC, follow-up date, status).
- None of the tabs write back into the manuscript itself — this agent only consumes a finished or in-progress draft (see [author.md](author.md) for drafting).

## Requirements
Pillow and ffmpeg (both already project dependencies) cover Quote Graphics/Shorts entirely for free. PublishDrive sales data needs `PUBLISHDRIVE_API_KEY` in `.env`. Better short-form narration needs `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` (optional — free macOS `say` is the default). Quote Finder's LLM step uses whatever provider/model is selected on the Overview tab.
