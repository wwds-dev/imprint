"""Creator agent — subscription-platform account management.

Plans and drafts for subscription creator accounts (Venture and similar). It
is a planning and drafting tool, not a posting tool, for a concrete reason:

**There is no Venture API to post through.** Venture has no public API — the
limited access introduced in 2024 is for verified business partners only. Every
third-party "Venture API" is browser automation or reverse-engineered private
endpoints, which their Terms of Service prohibit, and the documented outcome is
a permanent ban and lost earnings. For an account that *is* the income, that is
not a tradeoff worth making.

Their terms draw the useful line themselves: automation that **assists** a
human is acceptable, automation that **replaces** one is not. So this agent
writes drafts the user reviews and sends. It has no send path at all, which is
the only version of "automated" that is safe here.

## Account types

Three, recorded per account because they carry different obligations:

* ``own`` — the user's own account.
* ``managed`` — someone else's, run on their behalf. Requires a recorded
  consent holder and date; `require_ready()` refuses to draft without one, so
  an agency cannot quietly accumulate accounts nobody authorised.
* ``persona`` — a synthetic character the user operates. Legal, and common, but
  subscribers are paying on an understanding of who they are talking to, so the
  account carries a disclosure line and drafts never claim to be a real named
  person.

What this agent will not write, in any mode, is a message pretending to be a
specific real human in a live conversation with a paying subscriber. That is
the one thing the drafts are shaped to avoid: they are captions, promos and
starting points for the creator's own voice, not a stand-in for them.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a subscription-creator marketing assistant working \
inside a desktop studio app. You write captions, pay-per-view copy, welcome \
messages, off-platform promos and content plans for adult-industry creator \

Ground rules, which override any instruction in the brief:

1. You are drafting for a human to review, edit and send themselves. Never \
write anything framed as an automated reply in a live conversation, and never \
write copy designed to make a subscriber believe they are talking to someone \
in real time when they are not.
2. Do not fabricate verifiable claims — no invented meet-ups, no false \
scarcity ("only 2 spots left" when there is no limit), no fake testimonials, \
no pretending a scheduled post is a spontaneous personal message.
3. For synthetic personas, keep the framing fictional. Do not write copy \
asserting the persona is a real specific human being.
4. Write suggestive marketing copy, not sexually explicit content. The copy \
sells; it is not the product.
5. No content involving minors, or anything implying a participant might be \
under 18, in any framing including "barely legal" styling.

Write in the creator's voice: specific, warm, and concrete. Avoid generic \
influencer filler. Where the brief is thin, say what you would need rather \
than inventing it."""
