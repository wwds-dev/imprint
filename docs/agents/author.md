# MANUSCRIPT — Long-form writing studio

`key: author` · class: `agents/author_agent.py → AuthorAgent` · panel: `build_author_panel()` · handlers: `author_write()`, `author_continue()`, `author_pub_generate()`, `author_mkt_generate()`

> Handles off where this agent's Publish/Market modes stop short (real sales data, quote content, launch checklist): see the **Publisher** agent, `key: manuscript` — [manuscript.md](manuscript.md).

## What it does
A three-mode writing workspace for novelists and non-fiction authors alike:
1. **Write** — draft prose, outlines, characters, and world-building into separate editable tabs (fiction) or chapters/arguments (non-fiction, toggled via **Type**); every generation call auto-injects established Characters/World, recent draft text, and the Book Profile for continuity; a live **Chapters** tab navigates the draft; export to formatted EPUB, DOCX, or PDF.
2. **Publish** — generate query letters, synopses, blurbs, KDP metadata, and full KDP listing packages (categories, backend keywords, pricing).
3. **Market** — generate launch posts, ARC outreach, newsletter/press copy across 15 platforms.

All three modes read from one **Book Profile** (Title, Author, Content Type, Genre, Hook, Target Reader, Comp Titles, Publishing Path) — set it once, save it, and stop re-explaining the book on every request.

## Inputs (panel controls)
| Control | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Title / Author / **Type** (Fiction/Non-Fiction) | Project Bar — Type switches the Write-mode system prompt and Task list. |
| **Book Profile** (collapsible) | Hook, Target Reader, Comp Titles, Publishing Path, **Save Profile** — persisted, auto-loads next launch. |
| Task / mode | Options depend on Type — fiction: Write Scene / Develop Characters / Build World / etc.; non-fiction: Write Chapter / Strengthen Argument / Tighten Structure / etc. |
| Direction / instruction box | What to write next. |
| Provider / Model | Large-context model recommended. |
| Write / Continue / Stop / Save / Clear | Drafting lifecycle. |
| Author name / Format / **Export Book** | Renders the Draft tab to EPUB, DOCX, or PDF with a title page and detected chapter breaks. |
| Publish + Market sub-panels | Their own generate / copy / save buttons. |

## Outputs
Write mode tabs: **Draft**, **Outline**, **Characters**, **World**, **Chapters** (read-only navigator) — all editable except Chapters. Sidebar: word count, scene count, exported book file. Publish/Market render generated documents into their own areas with copy/save.

## How it works
`AuthorAgent.build_messages()` selects `SYSTEM_PROMPT` (fiction) or `SYSTEM_PROMPT_NONFICTION` based on `content_type`; both use structured markers — fiction adds `[CHARACTER]`/`[WORLD]` on top of the `[DRAFT]`/`[OUTLINE]` markers non-fiction also uses. `_parse_author_sections()` routes each marked block to the right tab, handling missing markers gracefully (non-fiction output just never populates Characters/World). `author_continue()` resends the current draft as context to keep going.

**Book Profile**: `_author_build_book_profile_block()` formats the profile fields into a "BOOK CONTEXT" system-prompt block, appended in all three modes (`build_messages()`, `build_publish_messages()`, `build_market_messages()` all accept `book_profile_context`). Verified: profile fields (hook, target reader, comp titles) show up organically in generated Publish/Market copy without being re-typed into those modes' own per-request fields. Persisted via `services/database.py`'s generic `settings` table (`author_book_profile` key, JSON) — no new table needed.

**Consistency memory**: `_author_build_consistency_context()` reads the Characters and World tabs (and, for fresh Write calls only, a bounded 3,000-char tail of the current Draft — Continue already sends the full draft another way, so it's skipped there to avoid duplicating it) and prepends them to the system prompt as a "CONTINUITY CONTEXT" block, after the Book Profile block. Empty tabs produce an empty context string — zero prompt overhead for a fresh project. Verified: injected details (e.g. which hand a scar is on) are respected in generated scenes.

**Chapters tab**: not a separate stored model — chapters are parsed live from the Draft text on every tab-switch via `services/book_exporter.py: split_into_chapters()` / `find_chapter_offsets()`, so there's never a second source of truth to drift from the actual draft. Double-clicking a chapter moves the Draft cursor to that heading and switches tabs.

Export (`author_export_book()`) hands the raw Draft text to `services/book_exporter.py`, which splits it into chapters by detecting `Chapter N` / `Part N` / `Prologue` / `Epilogue` heading lines (falls back to one unlabeled chapter if none are found — export always works, headings just improve structure) and renders a title page + chapters via EbookLib (EPUB), python-docx (DOCX), or reportlab (PDF, built directly — no DOCX→PDF conversion step, so no LibreOffice dependency).

## Under the hood — files & functions
| Location | Role |
|---|---|
| `agents/author_agent.py` | `AuthorAgent` — `SYSTEM_PROMPT`/`SYSTEM_PROMPT_NONFICTION` craft prompts + markers; all three `build_*_messages()` accept `book_profile_context`; `build_messages()` also takes `content_type`. |
| `services/book_exporter.py` | `split_into_chapters()`, `find_chapter_offsets()`, `export_epub()/export_docx()/export_pdf()`, `export_book()`. |
| `main.py: author_write()/author_continue()` | Write mode. |
| `main.py: _author_on_content_type_changed()` | Swaps the Task list to match Fiction/Non-Fiction. |
| `main.py: _author_get_book_profile()/_author_build_book_profile_block()` | Book Profile → system-prompt block. |
| `main.py: author_save_profile()/_author_load_profile()` | Profile persistence via `services/database.py` settings table. |
| `main.py: _author_build_consistency_context()/_author_start_worker()` | Continuity injection. |
| `main.py: _author_refresh_chapters()/_author_jump_to_chapter()` | Chapters navigator. |
| `main.py: author_export_book()` | Export handler — chapter detection + file dialog + format dispatch. |
| `main.py: author_pub_generate()/_copy()/_save()` | Publish mode. |
| `main.py: author_mkt_generate()/_copy()/_save()` | Market mode. |
| `main.py: _parse_author_sections()/_populate_author_tabs()` | Marker routing. |

## Extend it
- **Structured chapter model**: Chapters is currently a *view* derived from the Draft text, not a stored model — a real `Book`/`Chapter` data model (mirroring `services/course/models.py`) would additionally enable per-chapter regeneration, status tracking, and reordering.
- **Editing pass**: nothing currently re-reads a full draft for continuity/pacing/repetition — an "Editor" mode is the natural next addition.
- **Autonomous drive loop**: seed a premise → auto-expand outline → auto-draft each chapter → auto-compile, using the Book Profile, consistency context, and chapter navigator now in place as the foundation.
- **BookProfile auto-fill**: Publish/Market's own per-mode Hook/Comp-Titles fields aren't yet pre-filled from the Book Profile — they're independent fields you can still override per document, but nothing copies the Book Profile's Hook/Comps into them automatically.

## Requirements
Provider key. Large-context model (`claude-sonnet`/`gpt-4o`) for long manuscripts. Export needs `python-docx` and `reportlab` (both in `requirements.txt`); EPUB export uses `EbookLib`, already a dependency.
