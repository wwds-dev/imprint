# 2 · The agents, one by one

Six agents across four modes. Each one has a `📖 Docs` button that opens its own
reference sheet from `docs/agents/`; this page is the working guide.

## Write → Draft  *(author)*

![Draft](img/workspace-draft.png)

Long-form drafting: outlines, characters, scenes, dialogue, world-building.

| Control | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `Direction:` | What to write **next**. One concrete instruction beats a paragraph of context. |
| `Task:` | The shape of the output — Write Scene, Outline, Character, and so on. |
| `Draft / Outline / Characters / World Notes / Chapters` | Separate documents that persist per project. |
| **Write** | A fresh pass from the Direction box. |
| **Continue** | Extends the existing draft. Use this far more than Write. |

**Working method that holds up:** outline first in the Outline tab, then write
scene by scene with a one-line Direction each time. Long prompts asking for
"chapter 3" produce mush; "the argument in the kitchen, she leaves angry"
produces a scene.

The word and scene counters are live — useful when a publisher wants 80,000
words and you need to know where you stand.

## Write → Publish  *(author, publish page)*

![Publish](img/workspace-publish.png)

Turns a finished draft into the documents publishing actually asks for:
synopsis, blurb, query letter, one-page pitch.

`Comp Titles` matters more than it looks. "Gone Girl meets Dark Places" tells
the model the shelf, the tone and the reader in four words, and it is the field
most people leave blank.

## Write → Publish & Market → Market  *(author, market page)*

![Market](img/workspace-market.png)

Store-facing copy: Amazon description, launch posts, newsletter copy. `Platform`
changes the format — an Amazon description and a social post are not the same
text with different lengths.

## Publish  *(manuscript)*

![Publish agent](img/agent-manuscript.png)

Sales tracking and the publishing todo list.

- **Ingest KDP CSV** — Amazon has no public API, so royalties arrive as CSV
  reports you download from KDP. This reads them into the app's database.
- **Refresh Data** / **Period** — the metrics view over what has been ingested.
- **Publishing Todos** — a seeded checklist per platform (KDP, Draft2Digital,
  IngramSpark, PublishDrive).
- **Ask about your book** — questions answered against your own ingested numbers.

## Audio → Audiobooks  *(audiobook)*

Converts an ebook (PDF / EPUB / TXT / MOBI) into MP3 via OpenAI TTS.

Costed per character, so a full novel is not trivial — check the estimate before
starting. The conversion runs as a separate process and can be stopped.

**Note:** the panel opens a dialog if its input folder holds no supported ebook.
Point it at a folder with real files before selecting it.

---

## Audio → Music  *(music)*

![Music](img/agent-music.png)

Release planning rather than audio generation: artist profile, release setup,
distributor comparison, Spotify pitch, income roadmap.

Output marks **[AI OUTPUT — COPY-PASTE READY]** against **[HUMAN ACTION
REQUIRED]**, so you always know which parts you still have to do yourself.

---

## Web → Site Builder  *(webdesign)*

![Site Builder](img/agent-webdesign.png)

HTML/CSS/JS generation with the result split across `HTML`, `CSS` and `JS` tabs
plus a line count.

Fill in `Colour Palette` and `Framework` — left blank, the model picks for you,
and its default taste is generic.

---

## Gigs → Client Gigs  *(fiverr)*

![Client Gigs](img/agent-fiverr.png)

Logo concepts via DALL·E, gig descriptions, and client delivery messages.

**Generate Logos** is the paid, headline action — it bills per image. **Delivery
Msg** and **Gig Description** are text-only and cheap. The order log tracks what
you produced for whom.
