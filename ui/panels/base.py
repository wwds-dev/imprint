"""What every agent panel repeats: a provider box, a model box, and the code
that fills the second from the first.

Five panels carried their own `*_load_models` — webdesign, fiverr and author
byte-identical, manuscript and music differing in ways that turned out to
matter (see `ALL_PROVIDERS` and `load_models` below). This is the composition
half of phase 3: `GodAI` owns one `AgentPanel` per agent and delegates to it,
rather than a mixin reaching back into the window.

Phase 4 turns each panel into its own module built on this class. Nothing here
constructs a layout for that reason — a panel's arrangement is its own; only the
provider/model pair and its wiring are shared.
