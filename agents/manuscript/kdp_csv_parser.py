"""
KDP Sales Report CSV parser for Imprint.

KDP has no public API. You download reports manually from:
  KDP Dashboard → Reports → Sales Dashboard → Download

Drop the CSV into:   data/kdp_reports/

This parser watches that folder, ingests new files, and stores rows
in the manuscript_kdp_ingested table, deduplicating by filename.
