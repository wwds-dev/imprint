# Agent project architecture

Status: implemented foundation, September 2026.

## Goal

Each Imprint agent owns a repo-ready project directory while remaining
composable inside one desktop application.  This follows Sentinel's per-agent
ownership and SONAR's nested-companion precedent without prematurely creating
unpublished nested Git repositories.

## High-level design

```text
Imprint umbrella
├── main.py / ui/             window and remaining panel/workflow composition
├── services/                 shared persistence, providers, budgets, workers
├── agents/catalog.py         roster, labels, workspaces, profile locations
└── agents/<agent>/
    ├── __init__.py           stable public contract
    ├── agent.py              owned domain logic
    ├── panel.py              owned workspace (where extracted)
    ├── recommendations.py    owned task and quality requirements
    ├── README.md             operating boundary
    ├── TODO.md               committed work
    └── SUGGESTIONS.md        candidate work
```

Video deliberately keeps Vidforge as its separately versioned engine.  The
Video package owns Imprint's orchestration boundary, while
`agents/video/studio.py` is the adapter and `vidforge/` remains the companion
repository.

## Contracts

- The umbrella imports only package-level APIs such as `agents.author.AuthorAgent`.
- `agents.catalog.AgentSpec` is the only roster and navigation source of truth.
- Each selectable agent owns a recommendation profile; the shared engine ranks
  eligible providers and models from that profile.
- Agent packages may depend on shared services and provider protocols.
- Private implementation modules are not cross-agent APIs.
- Every catalog entry must have README, TODO and SUGGESTIONS documents.
- A packaged application must bundle those project documents.

## Data flow

```text
user action
  -> umbrella panel
  -> agent public API builds/validates domain request
  -> shared request guard authorises provider and budget
  -> shared worker/provider executes
  -> umbrella stores run, usage and project state
```

This keeps money, secrets, persistence and provider retries centralized.  An
agent can be extracted without forking those safety-critical services.

The same boundary applies to recommendations: an extracted agent carries its
requirements, while the host supplies the model catalog, availability, budget,
permissions and ranking policy. See `docs/recommendation_system.md`.

## Trade-offs

- Keeping one parent repository is less autonomous than nested Git repos, but a
  clone remains complete and releases remain atomic.
- Several panels still live in `main.py`; Music, Site Builder,
  Audiobook, Client Gigs and Video own their panels and workflows. The
  remaining panel and handler extraction is the next phase.
- Shared services reduce drift but mean an extracted agent needs a declared
  Imprint platform dependency.

## Extraction sequence

1. Move flat agent implementations behind package public APIs. **Done.**
2. Move each panel and its handlers into `agents/<key>/panel.py`. **Done
   2026-09-21 for all ten workspaces. The temporary host aliases are retired:
   shared integrations resolve controls through `GodAI._find_control()`.**
3. Move purely domain-specific services under their owner; keep cross-agent
   storage, providers, budgets and request guards shared. **Done 2026-09-21:
   book export (author); calendar, LLM parsing, PublishDrive, KDP CSV, quote
   graphics, shorts + their widgets/worker (manuscript); platforms, publishing,
   store (social); profile and plan calendar (creator);
   library + player (audiobook); the course pipeline (course). `services/`
   retains only cross-agent modules.**
4. Move focused tests into each agent project while retaining umbrella contract
   tests.
5. Only then publish selected agents as repositories and attach them as proper
   submodules, preserving history.

## Revisit as the system grows

When two independently released apps consume the same agent, extract a versioned
`imprint-platform` package for provider, budget and host protocols.  Until then,
a second copy would create more drift than independence.
