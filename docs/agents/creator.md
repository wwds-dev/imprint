# CREATOR — shared content production

`key: creator` · class: `agents/creator_agent.py → CreatorAgent` · panel: `build_creator_panel()` · handler: `creator_generate()`

## What it does
Creates concepts, captions, campaigns, posting plans, promotional asset briefs,
and calendars for every Imprint venture. A profile records its platform or
venture, so books and publishing, music, AltMerch, Venture, and future work can
share one production tool without sharing business-specific assumptions.

Venture trends, monetization, market context, and strategy live in the
top-level Venture workspace. Its **Create Campaign in Creator** action fills a
structured Creator brief while retaining source, freshness, confidence, risk,
format, pricing hypothesis, and requested deliverables.

## What it deliberately does not do
**It does not publish unattended, and it has no direct send path.**

Venture has no public API — the limited access introduced in 2024 is for
verified business partners only. Every third-party "Venture API" is browser
automation or a reverse-engineered private endpoint, which their Terms of
Service prohibit; the documented outcome is a permanent ban and lost earnings.
For an account that *is* the income, that is not a trade worth making.

Their terms draw the line themselves, and it is a sensible one: automation that
**assists** a human is fine, automation that **replaces** one is not. So this
agent produces drafts you review and send yourself.

It also will not write a message posing as a specific real person in a live
conversation with a paying subscriber. The drafts are captions, promos and
starting points in your voice — not a stand-in for you.

## Account types
Recorded per account, because the three carry different obligations.

| Type | Meaning | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| `own` | Your own account | — |
| `managed` | Someone else's, run on their behalf | An **authorisation record** — who approved it and when. Drafting is refused without it. |
| `persona` | A synthetic character you operate | A **disclosure line**. Drafts stay fictional in framing and never assert the persona is a real named human. |

The managed-account check lives on the drafting path (`require_ready()`), not
just in the dialog — a rule enforced only by a UI prompt is not enforced.

## Inputs (panel controls)
| Control | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Profile / Handle or project / Platform or venture | What is being created for and where it will be used. |
| Authorised by | Managed accounts only. Who consented. |
| Disclosure | Personas only. How the account discloses itself. |
| Draft | post · caption · campaign · posting plan · promo assets · hooks · bio · PPV · welcome · promo. |
| Price (USD) | PPV only — shapes the value argument in the copy. |
| Promo channel | Promo only — X, Reddit, TikTok, Instagram, Threads. |
| Brief | What it is about. Concrete briefs give non-generic drafts. |
| Provider / Model | Routed through the normal budget guard. |

## Outputs
Three tabs: **Draft** (editable output), **Calendar** (scheduled items you post
by hand — `draft → approved → posted` is a status you set yourself), and
**Earnings** (imported statements).

## Higgsfield promo video
`Generate Teaser` sends a safe-for-work prompt to the Higgsfield API for a
promo clip aimed at the off-platform funnels where subscription traffic
actually originates.

Imprint uses Higgsfield's current request contract: a key ID + secret pair,
model-specific endpoints, presigned reference-image uploads, and the returned
status/cancel URLs. Add `HF_API_KEY_ID` and `HF_API_KEY_SECRET` to the private
`.env`, then enable **Higgsfield** in the API permissions row. The Creator panel
asks the official estimate endpoint for the exact request, shows that quote in
the normal budget approval, and only then submits the paid render.

Renders can be canceled while queued. Once processing begins Higgsfield cannot
cancel them, so Imprint keeps watching and saves the finished file. Job state,
price, policy outcome and correlation ID are stored in `creator_video_jobs`, and
the output is copied into the Media library because hosted output URLs are not
permanent. Select a Calendar row before clicking `Generate Teaser` to attach the
finished video directly to that item.

Higgsfield's Terms of Use prohibit **sexually explicit material** and
**unauthorised images of other people**, and moderate prompts, reference images
*and* outputs; circumventing moderation is itself a violation, and breaching it
terminates the account. `services/higgsfield_client.check_prompt()` refuses
those requests locally, before the spend, with a reason — negated mentions
("no nudity") are allowed, since those are instructions to the model rather
than requests for it.

The practical consequence: **explicit content cannot come from Higgsfield.**
Its role here is the teaser, not the product.

## Earnings
`📥 Import Earnings CSV` reads a statement exported from the platform — the
same pattern as the KDP importer, for the same reason: no API, so the numbers
only exist here once you export and import them. Keyed on
`(account, filename)`, so re-importing the same export updates rather than
double-counting.

Column names differ per platform and change over time, so the parser matches
header substrings and stores the raw rows alongside the totals.

## Under the hood — files & functions
| Location | Role |
|---|---|
| `agents/creator_agent.py` | `CreatorAgent`, `require_ready()`, prompt construction. |
| `services/higgsfield_client.py` | Official video API lifecycle, upload, estimate, cancellation and content-policy guard. |
| `services/creator_csv.py` | Earnings statement parsing and ingest. |
| `main.py: build_creator_panel()` | Account section, compose section, seven tabs. |
| `main.py: creator_generate()/creator_schedule()/creator_import_earnings()` | Lifecycle. |
| `creator_accounts` / `creator_content` / `creator_earnings` | Tables. |

## Notes
- Nothing here touches the platform. Removing an account removes it from
  Imprint only.
- Adult content platforms have their own rules about AI-assisted material, and
  they change. Read them; this app does not track them for you.
