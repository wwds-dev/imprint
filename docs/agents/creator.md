# BRAND CREATOR — shared identity and content production

`key: creator` · class: `agents/creator/agent.py → CreatorAgent` · panel: `build_creator_panel()` · handler: `creator_generate()`

## What it does
Creates concepts, captions, campaigns, posting plans, promotional asset briefs,
and calendars for every Imprint venture. A profile records its platform or
venture, so books and publishing, music, AltMerch, and future work can
share one production tool without sharing business-specific assumptions.

## What it deliberately does not do
**It does not publish unattended, and it has no direct send path.**

Imprint has no authorised platform posting integration. It does not use browser
automation or a private endpoint. Platform rules change and may only be
available inside a logged-in creator account, so this agent produces drafts
you review and publish manually rather than claiming an unverified rule allows
automation.

It also will not write a message posing as a specific real person in a live
conversation with a paying subscriber. The drafts are captions, promos and
starting points in your voice — not a stand-in for you.

## Account types
Recorded per account, because the three carry different obligations.

| Type | Meaning | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| `own` | Your own account | — |
| `managed` | Someone else's, run on their behalf | An **authorisation record** — who approved it and when. Drafting is refused without it. |
| `persona` | A synthetic character you operate | A **disclosure line** and a dated, source-backed platform policy expressly allowing it. Unknown blocks generation. |

The managed-account check lives on the drafting path (`require_ready()`), not
just in the dialog — a rule enforced only by a UI prompt is not enforced.

## Inputs (panel controls)
| Control | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Profile / Handle or project / Platform or venture | What is being created for and where it will be used. |
| Authorised by | Managed accounts only. Who consented. |
| Disclosure | Personas only. How the account discloses itself. |
| Review platform policy | Dated source, synthetic-permission state, verified-owner rule, AI disclosure, and publishing route. A saved `official_api` note does not enable posting. |
| Draft | post · caption · campaign · posting plan · promo assets · hooks · bio · PPV · welcome · promo. |
| Price (USD) | PPV only — shapes the value argument in the copy. |
| Campaign / Channel | Attach an asset to a test and destination for later comparison. |
| Brief | What it is about. Concrete briefs give non-generic drafts. |
| Provider / Model | Routed through the normal budget guard. |

## Outputs
The **Draft** tab has editable output; **Calendar** holds items you post by
hand, and **Earnings** joins imported statements to manually recorded asset
outcomes without adding overlapping receipts. Voice, Media, Agency and Records
remain separate tabs.

With a named Project selected, a generated draft carries that Project and its
content profile into Calendar when you schedule it. If you switch to another
profile before scheduling, Imprint refuses the cross-account save rather than
silently filing someone else's copy there. Teaser jobs and finished or imported
media can also be linked to the Project active at approval or import. The
profile, consent and earnings records remain account-owned: deleting a Project
unfiles its content and teaser jobs but does not delete those records or media
files. Calendar and Media currently show everything for the selected account,
not just the active Project; hover a Calendar title to see its Project.

## Higgsfield promo video
`Generate Teaser` sends a safe-for-work prompt to the Higgsfield API for a
promo clip aimed at the off-platform funnels where subscription traffic
actually originates.

Imprint uses Higgsfield's current request contract: a key ID + secret pair,
model-specific endpoints, presigned reference-image uploads, and the returned
status/cancel URLs. Add `HF_API_KEY_ID` and `HF_API_KEY_SECRET` to the private
`.env`, then enable **Higgsfield** in the API permissions row. The Creator panel
asks the official estimate endpoint for the exact request, shows that quote in
the normal budget approval, and only then submits the paid render.

Renders can be canceled while queued. Once processing begins Higgsfield cannot
cancel them, so Imprint keeps watching and saves the finished file. Job state,
price, policy outcome and correlation ID are stored in `creator_video_jobs`, and
the output is copied into the Media library because hosted output URLs are not
permanent. Select a Calendar row before clicking `Generate Teaser` to attach the
finished video directly to that item.

Higgsfield's Terms of Use prohibit **sexually explicit material** and
**unauthorised images of other people**, and moderate prompts, reference images
*and* outputs; circumventing moderation is itself a violation, and breaching it
terminates the account. `services/higgsfield_client.check_prompt()` refuses
those requests locally, before the spend, with a reason — negated mentions
("no nudity") are allowed, since those are instructions to the model rather
than requests for it.

Its role here is the safe-for-work promotional teaser.

## Earnings
`📥 Import Earnings CSV` reads a statement exported from the platform — the
same pattern as the KDP importer, for the same reason: no API, so the numbers
only exist here once you export and import them. Keyed on
`(account, filename)`, so re-importing the same export updates rather than
double-counting.

Column names differ per platform and change over time, so the parser matches
header substrings and stores the raw rows alongside the totals.

Select a Calendar asset, then use **Record outcome** to enter its real post
link, source/window, reach, clicks, subscriptions, PPV purchases, attributed
revenue, and all-in cost in USD. The drafting request's model cost is saved in
EUR; the dashboard never adds it to USD without a user-provided conversion.
ROI is shown only for an entered cost and is a descriptive return on that
cost, not proof of causation or profit. The chosen hook and campaign/channel
remain visible for like-for-like comparisons.

## Under the hood — files & functions
| Location | Role |
|---|---|
| `agents/creator/agent.py` | `CreatorAgent`, `require_ready()`, prompt construction. |
| `services/higgsfield_client.py` | Official video API lifecycle, upload, estimate, cancellation and content-policy guard. |
| `agents/creator/earnings_csv.py` | Earnings statement parsing and ingest. |
| `main.py: build_creator_panel()` | Account section, compose section, six tabs. |
| `main.py: creator_generate()/creator_schedule()/creator_import_earnings()` | Lifecycle. |
| `creator_accounts` / `creator_content` / `creator_earnings` | Tables. |

## Notes
- Nothing here touches the platform. Removing an account removes it from
  Imprint only.
- Platforms have their own rules about AI-assisted material, and they change.
  Read them; this app does not track them for you.
